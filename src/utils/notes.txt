Observations/questions on data model:
    -   Will the variable names stay the same?
    -   Only one kind of connections (partner)
        -   Maybe connection should be its own kind of object (with type and ID arrays or something)
    -   Places don't include coordinates
    -   What format will the content be in? (plain text vs. markup)
